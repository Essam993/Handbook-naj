# Unit Testing

Unit testing is crucial for catching bugs early and ensuring that individual components and functions work as expected. By implementing thorough unit tests, you can detect errors before they reach production and improve the reliability of your codebase. Hereâ€™s an overview of our recommended testing toolkit:

## Unit Testing Tools

### Jest

Jest is a versatile testing framework that provides a comprehensive testing environment. It supports various types of tests, including unit tests, integration tests, and snapshot tests.

- **Documentation**: [Jest Documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)

### React Testing Library

React Testing Library promotes good testing practices by focusing on user interactions rather than the implementation details of your components. This approach helps ensure that your components behave as expected from the user's perspective.

- **Documentation**: [React Testing Library Documentation](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)

### React Hooks Testing Library

The React Hooks Testing Library is specifically designed for testing custom hooks and React components. It provides utilities to test hooks in isolation and ensures they work as intended.

- **Documentation**: [React Hooks Testing Library Documentation](https://react-hooks-testing-library.com/)

## End-to-End Testing

### Cypress

For end-to-end (E2E) testing, Cypress is our tool of choice. It excels at simulating real user interactions and validating application behavior from the user's perspective, providing a complete view of how your application performs in a real-world scenario.

- **Documentation**: [Cypress Documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/)

By incorporating these testing tools into your development workflow, you can ensure robust and reliable code, reduce bugs, and improve the overall quality of your application.
