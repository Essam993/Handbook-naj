# Codebase Structure

## Building an Efficient and Collaborative Environment

Ensuring a well-structured codebase empowers both individual developers and collaborative teams to work efficiently and effectively. By adhering to consistent file organization principles, we cultivate a codebase that is:

- **Easily Navigable**: Developers can quickly locate and understand code components.
- **Collaboration-Friendly**: Team members can seamlessly contribute to different areas of the project.
- **Maintainable**: Long-term code health is preserved, even with team changes.
- **Inspiring**: Shared structure encourages learning and inspiration from colleagues' code.

## Standardizing Files and Folders

### Project Root Essentials

The project root directory should house the following files and folders:

- **`package.json`**: Manages project dependencies, scripts, and configuration.
- **`README.md`**: Provides a comprehensive project overview, installation steps, and usage guidance.
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and folders to exclude from version control.
- **`.babelrc`**: Configures Babel transpilation settings.
- **`.editorconfig`**: Establishes common editor settings for consistency across team members.
- **`.eslintignore`**: Identifies files to exclude from ESLint linting.
- **`.eslintrc.js`**: Customizes ESLint linting rules to ensure code quality.
- **`.npmrc`**: Sets global configuration for the npm package manager.
- **`.prettierignore`**: Lists files to exclude from Prettier formatting.
- **`.prettierrc`**: Defines Prettier formatting rules for consistent code style.
- **`jest.config.js`**: Configures the Jest unit testing framework.
- **`tsconfig.json`**: Defines TypeScript compilation settings.
- **`yarn.lock`**: Locks down specific package versions installed with Yarn.

### Folder Organization Best Practices

- **Group Related Files**: Avoid cluttered main folders by grouping related files into logical subdirectories.
- **Follow Consistent Logic**: Structure subdirectories based on functionality or feature areas.
- **Utilize Clear and Concise Naming**: Choose descriptive names that accurately reflect folder contents.
- **Embrace Hierarchy**: Establish a clear hierarchy of folders and subfolders for optimal organization.

By embracing these guidelines, we collectively contribute to a codebase that is not only well-structured but also sets the stage for efficient development, seamless collaboration, and long-term maintainability.
