# Naming Conventions

## Shaping a Shared Language: Naming Conventions for Clarity and Cohesion

Just as we rely on consistent grammar and vocabulary to communicate effectively in human languages, our codebase benefits from a shared set of naming conventions. By adhering to these guidelines, we create a unified and intuitive ecosystem that fosters understanding, collaboration, and maintainability.

## Crafting Meaningful Component Names: Signposts for Navigation

Imagine each component as a well-labeled signpost within our codebase. Its name should instantly convey its purpose and functionality, even when encountered in isolation. To achieve this clarity, consider these principles:

- **Self-Description**: Choose names that clearly reflect the component's role and behavior.
- **Specificity**: Avoid ambiguity by using names that distinguish components uniquely.
- **Conciseness**: Strive for names consisting of one, two, or three words for readability.

## General Conventions: Harmony in the Codebase

Beyond components, we extend consistent naming practices to other elements of our codebase to ensure a cohesive and intuitive experience:

- **Consistency Above All**: Maintain uniform naming conventions throughout the project for effortless navigation and understanding.
- **Components and Pages**: Embrace PascalCase (e.g., `MyComponent`, `HomePage`) for proper nouns and constructs.
- **Functions and Variables**: Adopt camelCase (e.g., `myFunction`, `isLoggedIn`) for descriptive naming of actions and values.
- **Files**: Mirror PascalCase in filenames (e.g., `MyComponent.ts`, `HomePage.ts`) for consistency with content.
- **Hooks**: Employ PascalCase with the "use" prefix (e.g., `useMyEffect`, `useMyState`) to distinguish custom hooks.
- **Constants**: Signify unchanging values with UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `API_URL`, `ERROR_CODE_404`) for clarity and distinction.
- **Directories**: Choose either PascalCase or kebab-case (e.g., `Components`, `atoms/molecules`) based on team preference for organization.

By embracing these conventions, we collectively weave a tapestry of clear and meaningful code that speaks to developers of all levels, fostering collaboration and long-term project success.
